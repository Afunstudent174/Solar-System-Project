<h2> What Is The Solar System?</h2>
<p>
The Solar System is the gravitationally bound system of the Sun and the objects that orbit it.
 It formed 4.6 billion years ago from the gravitational collapse of a giant interstellar molecular cloud. 
The vast majority (99.86%) of the system's mass is in the Sun, with most of the remaining mass contained in the planet Jupiter. 
The four inner system planets—Mercury, Venus, Earth and Mars—are terrestrial planets, being composed primarily of rock and metal. 
The four giant planets of the outer system are substantially larger and more massive than the terrestrials.
 The two largest, Jupiter and Saturn, are gas giants, being composed mainly of hydrogen and helium; the next two, Uranus and Neptune, 
are ice giants, being composed mostly of volatile substances with relatively high melting points compared with hydrogen and helium, such as water, ammonia, and methane.

<h2> Fun Facts </h2>
<section>
If we ever manage to travel to the gas planets, you might be in for a bit of a shock when you step off the spaceship.
 That’s because Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus and Neptune don’t have solid surfaces - they have a rocky core, but are mainly big balls of hydrogen and helium.
 If you’re travelling to Mars anytime soon, be sure to bring your big coat. Its average temperature is roughly -60°C, the same as the South Pole (minus the penguins).
 Some scientists, in the hopes of making it more habitable, have suggested ways in which we could make Mars warmer.
 One of these ideas is to build giant mirrors that will reflect the Sun's rays, and kick-start some speedy Martian warming.
Saturn is home to the Solar System’s most epic ice rink. Being so far from the Sun, the water in its rings is frozen into ice.
 It is one of four planets that have rings around them - the other gas planets do too. However, the rest were undiscovered until the 1970s when probes went to explore them.
 Saturn’s were the first rings seen through telescopes from Earth.
 In three months you could write a book, pass your driving test or learn basic guitar. It’s also the amount of time it takes Mercury to travel around the Sun.
 It’s the shortest orbit in the Solar System, because Mercury is the closest planet to the Sun.
 So, next time someone asks you when you’ll get around to mowing the lawn, tell them it’ll be in roughly one Mercurian year.
